# Pynetics Coding Plan

This coding plan outlines the structure and components of the Pynetics project, a genetic simulation in Python.

- [ ] Create a conda environment for the project.

- [ ] Add some documentation about the project setup in a README.md file.

- [ ] Definir cuál es la biblioteca que vamos a usar para dibujo
    - [ ] Arcade
    - [ ] Pyglet
    - [ ] PyGame (This is very simple and I think it will be enough)
- [ ] Create a requirements.txt file to manage dependencies.

- [ ] Define a very simple entity class with basic attributes:
    - [ ] Genes
        - [ ] Stamina
        - [ ] Energy Efficiency

- [ ] Define very simple attributes for the environment:
    - [ ] Food availability
    - [ ] Danger zones
    - [ ] Way to tick the environment
- [ ] Draw the environment + entities on screen

- [ ] Implement a basic simulation loop

- [ ] Define the complete list of genes
